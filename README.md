# Trona Pinnacles Seismic Analysis - Mathematica Notebook

## Repository Overview
This repository contains a **Mathematica Notebook** used for computing the **natural frequencies** of rock towers (RTs) at **Trona Pinnacles, California**. The analysis supports research on the **seismic response and failure mechanisms** of these fragile geologic features presented in **Seismic response of rock towers at the Trona Pinnacles (USA) to the 2019 Ridgecrest Earthquake Sequence: theory, models, and observations**.

## Repository Contents
- `NaturalFrequencies.nb` – **Main Mathematica Notebook** for computing natural frequencies of the pinnacles.
- `data/` – Directory containing input datasets (e.g., material properties, geometric parameters).


## Context
This work builds upon the **finite element modeling (FEM) approach** used to analyze the seismic response of the pinnacles, as discussed in:
- Garcia-Suarez, J., McPhillips, D., & Asimaki, D. (2024). _Seismic response of rock towers at the Trona Pinnacles (USA) to the 2019 Ridgecrest Earthquake Sequence: theory, models, and observations_.
